# Class Notes

## Misc

### Class github

Check it [out](https://github.com/tatecarson/LSU-PDM-Spring-2018)

### Chrome errors

If you use chrome and are getting deprecated messages I wouldn't worry too much as long as everything is still working. Those yellow messages just mean that some parts will stop working eventually, and hopefully the maintainer of tone will fix the issues before too long. Another option is to just use Firefox.

### Code formatting

Be sure to format your code correctly before turning in an assignment. You will get points off for messy code. Most code editors will do this for you. If yours doesn't it might be a good idea to use one that does. It saves a lot of time and cuts down on bugs.

### Spectrogram

Sometimes it is useful to visualize the sound. [Here's](./Fx_spectrogram/) an example project that that does that.

### Listen for key press
