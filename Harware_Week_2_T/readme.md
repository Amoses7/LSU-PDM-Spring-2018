# Class Notes

## Code examples

### Fading - Tate

code at -> examples/analog/Fading.ino

[Arduiono tutorial](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Fading)

#### Analog write

This is our first example that writes an analog value. Where digital is either on or off, high or low, analog has more granularity. It is used for things when you want varying values, like fading an LED.

### Pulse width modulation (PWM)

some good information from arduino:  
[Arduino info](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PWM)

A way to get analog results with digital means. A square wave is created and modulated at a certain tempo to get an analog effect.

### Morse code example - Simron

### AnalogInput - Tate
